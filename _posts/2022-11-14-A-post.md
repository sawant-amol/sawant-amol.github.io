Inheritence is when we have a base-class and a number of sub-classes that derive from the base-class.
In human analogy, the Parent is the base-class and the Child is the sub-class that inherits from the parent.
The sub-class has the properties of the base-class and in addition provides new properties from itself.
This extends the functionality of the sub-class over the base-class.

Polymorphism makes use of inheritence to '*override*' certain behaviors in the base-class from the sub-class.
It does so by using the specifier keyword **virtual** for the behavior method. This implies that particular method can be *overridden* 
by its sub-class method with the same method signature.

There are a couple other keywords, **override** and **final** that go with the sub-class method to specify explicitly about the method 
which is being overridden and the method which cannot be further overridden (final).
