title: Memory Leak analysis with valgrind

Whenever we write programs that involve any sort memory allocation, 
we need to worry about heap memory. With the heap memory limited to a finite amount per process,
it becomes important that the program frees any allocations that were made.

### Welcome to Valgrind

Valgrind offers many [tools](https://valgrind.org/info/tools.html) to perform various profiling analysis.
One of them being memory profiling.

```
$ valgrind --leak-check=full ./helloworld
```

The above command runs the *helloworld* binary generated with debug build-flags
and provides a summary of memory usage.

```
==83167== HEAP SUMMARY:
==83167==     in use at exit: 64 bytes in 4 blocks
==83167==   total heap usage: 8 allocs, 4 frees, 1,136 bytes allocated
==83167== 
==83167== 64 (16 direct, 48 indirect) bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 4 of 4

==83167== LEAK SUMMARY:

==83167==    indirectly lost: 48 bytes in 3 blocks
==83167==      possibly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==83167==    still reachable: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==83167==         suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==83167== 
==83167== Use --track-origins=yes to see where uninitialised values come from
==83167== For lists of detected and suppressed errors, rerun with: -s
==83167== ERROR SUMMARY: 5 errors from 3 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0)
```

Here's another output where there is no memory leaks.

```
==85518== HEAP SUMMARY:
==85518==     in use at exit: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==85518==   total heap usage: 13 allocs, 13 frees, 74,520 bytes allocated
==85518== 
==85518== All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible
==85518== 
==85518== For lists of detected and suppressed errors, rerun with: -s
==85518== ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0)
```
