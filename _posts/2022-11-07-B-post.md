With our knowledge of how to set compiler flags in CMakeLists.txt,
we will move onto profiling of applications, starting with *gprof*.

## Profiling Tools

### [gprof](https://gernotklingler.com/blog/gprof-valgrind-gperftools-evaluation-tools-application-level-cpu-profiling-linux/)

In order to use *gprof* we first need to enable a specific compiler flag *[-pg](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Instrumentation-Options.html#Instrumentation-Options)*
This is required not only for compiler but also for linker.

```
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -pg -Wall")
```

Add this flag to every project (CMakeLists.txt) in your build.

Next, build the application and run it. This will create **gmon.out**
Finally execute *gprof* on the *gmon.out*

```
$ gprof <binaryname>
```

NOTE: **gprof does not support profiling multi-threaded applications and also cannot profile shared libraries.**
This makes it totally unsuitable for todayâ€™s real-world projects.
