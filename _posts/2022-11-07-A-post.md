title: How-To add Compiler flags in CMakeLists.txt

Having seen what the *Debug* mode compiler flags are in the previous post, 
we will now look at how to specify the compiler flags we need during our development.

```
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -Wall")
```

This sets the compiler flags for the whole project. In order to have finer control, we can define the flags per target,

```
target_compile_options(mytarget
  PRIVATE
    -O1
)
```

Here we used the **target_compile_options** command to specify the -O1 flag per target. -O1 is optimization level-1.
